    <string name="bio">Now itâ€™s your turn to complete this exercise.
\n\nAdd a ScrollView with a TextView showing information about yourself to the layout.
\n\nStyle the TextView with NameStyle, and add additional styling to separate the scrollable text from the edges of the screen.
\n\nAdd some spacing between the lines using the lineSpacingMultiplier property to the TextView
\n\nBelow is a skeleton code version for this challenge.
\n\n\nThe important thing to remember is that since ScrollView can only have one child, you have to wrap that ImageView and the TextView into a LinearLayout.
\n
\n\n\n\nThere is no solution code provided for this challenge,
\n\n\nbut the skeleton code below gives you the expected view hierarchy to use.
